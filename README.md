# `coilcalc` - Concentric coils field gradient calculator
## Introduction
Highly uniform magnetic field with minimal lateral field gradient is required for the generation and maintaining of hyperpolarized <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>129</sup>Xe gas. `coilcalc` is designed to be useful in the design, simulation and optimization of magnet systems used to support such systems.
## Limitations
This software is not a fully-functional electromagnetism FEM suite. Only co-axial sets of circular coils can be modelled. While such geometry is extremely useful in generating uniform magnetic fields, this software is no replacement for a competent FEM software for more complex problems.
## Usage
Users are encouraged to refer to cookbook examples for usage examples with line-by-line comments.
